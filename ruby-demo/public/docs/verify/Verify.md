# Verify Demo
## What it does
The Verify Demo demonstrates the capability of the Kairos Face Recognition API to verify human faces by giving the user three methods for presenting photos for verification.   In each method, the application compares two faces, gives the user a message of MATCH or NO MATCH, and presents confidence percentage for that result.
