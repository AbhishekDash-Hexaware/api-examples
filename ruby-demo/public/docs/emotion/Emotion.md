# Emotion Demo
## What it does
The Emotion Demo showcases the Kairos Emotion API by giving the user four methods for analyzing human emotions in a video stream.  In each method, video data is passed to the API, which returns a JSON object with frame by frame emotional values ranging from 1 to 100.  By implementing area graphs, the data is displayed visually to the user.
