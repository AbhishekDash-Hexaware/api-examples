# Recognize Demo
## What it does
The Recognize Demo demonstrates the capability of the Kairos Face Recognition API to recognize human faces by allowing the user to enroll images into a gallery by dragging them into a window.  The user can then drag an image into another window to see if it matches any of the enrolled images.
